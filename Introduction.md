# Processing_Code

WELCOME

This code it has been made mainly because I wanted to improve my  programing skills. I have to give most of the credit of this repository to Daniel Shiffman, wich book "The Nature Of Code" has guide me on my code development and improvement. 

Most of the code has been based of the topics he explains in his book. However i should say all of the code I have wrote on this repository has been made only BASED on his code, it is not a cut an paste of his code.

This repository also includes some exercices and leftovers from other kind of challenges (or boredom) but they are kind of messy. And also it might be some mistakes, after all is a first aproach to a Java enviroment, so don't espect any kind of profesional comments or estructure.

I'm also open to any kind of advice you may want to give me, so don't feel ashamed and feel free to comment anything, I will be thankful for your implication.
